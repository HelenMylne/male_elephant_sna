This notebook documents code that first *simulates the process of assigning age categories to elephants*, and then *tests the Bayesian Stan model's ability to assign age distributions to individuals* based on their age category.

The code also *highlights the problem in using age category bins* and why we want to do this.

```{r}
library(cmdstanr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggdist)
```

First let's simulate an age distribution based on a Weibull distribution where we set the shape and scale parameters.

```{r}
probs <- dweibull(1:100, shape = 1.2, scale = 30)
probs <- (probs/sum(probs))
plot(probs) 
```

Now we create a fictional population with ages selected from that distribution. We also add an error for age estimation.

```{r}
N <- 100 # Number of individuals
K <- 6 # Number of age bin categories
elephants_ls <- list(
  N = N,
  K = K, 
  # Simulated ages drawn from the Weibull distribution plus an error in age estimation
  age = sample(1:100, N, replace=TRUE, prob=probs)
  #age_category_index = sample(1:4,20,replace=TRUE)
)
```

Next simulate observing ages with error and then binning them into age groups

```{r}
E <- 3 # Error (in either direction) of age estimates
elephants_ls$age_guess <- elephants_ls$age + sample(-E:E, N, replace=TRUE)
elephants_ls$age_category_index <- sapply(elephants_ls$age_guess, function(x) which.max(x < c(15, 30, 45, 60, Inf)))
hist(elephants_ls$age_category)
```

Let's look at the actual age verses the biologist assigned age and look at the thresholds. You can see that the chance of being mis-classified is lower if an actual age is in the middle of the age category. Also, there is mostly a bias towards ages within the age class actually being towards the lower end of the class.

```{r}
data.frame(elephants_ls) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=age, y=age_guess, col=factor(age_category_index))) +
    geom_point(size=4,alpha=0.6) +
    geom_vline(xintercept=c(15,30,45,60,75), col=factor(2:6), linetype="dashed", alpha=0.6) +
    theme_minimal() + 
    xlab("Assigned age") + ylab("Age")
```


Now we read in the Stan model to estimate ages from the categories based on a Weibull distribution (for real data these will be centred on parameters from fitting to age estimates based on another elephant population)

```{r}
latent_age_ordinal_model <- cmdstan_model("models/elephant_latent_age_ordinal_regression_dwf_22.03.18.stan")
```
Fit model with cmdstanr

```{r message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, include=FALSE}
age_estimation_fit <- latent_age_ordinal_model$sample(
  data = elephants_ls, 
  chains = 4, 
  parallel_chains = 1,
  iter_sampling = 2000
)
```
Examine the estimates. We can plot the estimated ages against the biologist assigned ages and ...

```{r}

age_est_mat <- age_estimation_fit$summary()[102:201, ]

plot_data <- data.frame(age = elephants_ls$age,       # Biologists original age est
                        model_age = age_est_mat$mean) # Mean modelled age

plot_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(age), y = model_age)) +
    geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.6) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = c(15,30,45,60,75), linetype = "dashed", alpha = 0.6) +
    theme_minimal() + 
    xlab("Assigned age") + ylab("Modelled age")
```

Now an equivalent posterior predictive plot from draws from the distribution to show uncertainty around the mean age (then need to do it with full uncertainty).

```{r}
library(posterior)
library(bayesplot)

true_ages <- age_estimation_fit$draws("true_age", format="df")
#mcmc_dens(true_ages)
true_ages <- true_ages[1:100,1:N]

df <- as.data.frame(do.call(rbind, true_ages)) %>%
            mutate(true_age = elephants_ls$age) %>% relocate(true_age) %>%
            mutate(ID = 1:nrow(true_ages)) %>% relocate(ID)

df <- df %>% pivot_longer(cols = 3:102) %>% select(-name)

df %>% ggplot(aes(x=true_age, y=value, group=factor(ID))) +
    geom_point(size=2,alpha=0.1) +
    #stat_halfeye() +
    geom_vline(xintercept=c(15,30,45,60,75), linetype="dashed", alpha=0.6) +
    geom_hline(yintercept=c(15,30,45,60,75), linetype="dashed", alpha=0.6) +
    theme_bw() + 
    xlab("Assigned age") + ylab("Modelled age")
```
