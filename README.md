# test -- so called because I was just testing out how to get my laptop contents up here, committing each change one at a time so I would still have the full version history, but now I can't get it to correct...

First chapter of PhD research -- for three populations of male elephants, estimates ages, dyad edge weights, and performs regression analyses of edge weight on age and age difference.

For all: MOTNP = Mosi-Oa-Tunya National Park (Zambia); ANP = Amboseli National Park (Kenya); MPNP = Makgadikgadi National Park (Botswana).

Process: Step 1a -- data_processing) Convert all sightings into counts of sightings of a dyad together and apart in a 2 year period Step 1b -- data_processing) Convert all age category estimations of males into distributions of true age based on assigned category and survival curve for elephants. Step 2 -- data_analysis) Use counts of dyad sightings to estimate dyadic edge weights. Step 3 -- data_analysis) Perform nodal and dyadic regressions of edge weight on age/age difference, using age distributions calculated in 1b and edge weight distributions from 2.
