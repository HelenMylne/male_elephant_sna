#### Defining the model ####
# The dyadic regression model weâ€™ll be using will predict the edge weight using a Gaussian family model where dyad type is the main effect, and multi-membership terms are included as random effects to account for non-independence between edges due to nodes. Since edge weights can co-vary, we need to model the joint posterior distributions over edge weights as the response variable in the regression model. This can be achieved by modelling the mean edge weights y_mu as a multivariate normal with a covariance matrix y_sigma calculated from the edge weight posterior. In Stan this looks like:
  
#  logit_edge_mu ~ multi_normal(predictor, logit_edge_cov + diag_matrix(rep_vector(square(sigma), N)));

# where predictor is the predictor term (like a + b * x in simple linear regression). Modelling edge weights with a multivariate normal allows the joint uncertainty over edge weights to be taken into account by the model. Weakly informative priors are used in this example, but in any real analysis they should be determined by domain knowledge and predictive checks.

### define the priors:
# Hypothesis 0: Age has no impact on association.
# Hypothesis 1: Elephants will prefer to associate with age mates because they are more similar and are available as sparring partners. Effect of age difference will therefore be negative so a greater age gap = smaller probability of association.
# Hypothesis 2: Young elephants will prefer to associate with older males because they can act as sources of information. Old elephants will prefer to associate with young males because they can control their musth and don't act as sources of competition. Effect of age difference will therefore be positive so a greater age gap = greater probability of association.
# Hypothesis 3: Some combination of Hypotheses 1 and 2 is true. Effect of age difference will therefore have quite high variance and uncertainty, likely spanning 0 due to preferences in both directions.
# Hypothesis 4: Young elephants will prefer to associate with other young elephants for sparring and because they may be more familiar with individuals closer in age through their maternal herds (esp. in MOTNP). Older males will show no preference as they are already established in the environment and may not require sparring partners. There will therefore be an interaction effect between average age of the dyad and the age difference between them.

#### Interpret model ####
# Assuming weâ€™ve now carried out any diagnostics we think are appropriate, itâ€™s finally time to answer the scientific questions that led us to conduct the analysis. We can start off by calculating the 95% credible intervals of the model parameters. This can be done using the following code:

# At this point it becomes clear that the regression weâ€™ve conducted is not exactly the same as what might be expected from standard frequentist regressions, where categories are interpreted relative to a reference category. Instead, a parameter is estimated for each category, and we can use contrasts to calculate the magnitude of differences between categories of interest. Contrasts are easily calculated as the statistic of interest from the posteriors of the model. We simply compute the difference in posteriors between the different categories using the following code:
